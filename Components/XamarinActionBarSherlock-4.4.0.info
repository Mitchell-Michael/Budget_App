{"Name":"ActionBarSherlock for Xamarin","Id":290,"Alias":"XamarinActionBarSherlock","Description":"Xamarin.Android Binding for ActionBarSherlock\n=============================================\n\nThis package is a binding for ActionBarSherlock Android library by Jake Wharton.\n\nActionBarSherlock\n=================\n\nActionBarSherlock is a standalone library designed to facilitate the use of\nthe action bar design pattern across all versions of Android through a single\nAPI.\n\nThe library will automatically use the [native ActionBar][2] implementation on\nAndroid 4.0 or later. For previous versions which do not include ActionBar, a\ncustom action bar implementation based on the sources of Ice Cream Sandwich\nwill automatically be wrapped around the layout. This allows you to easily\ndevelop an application with an action bar for every version of Android from 2.x\nand up.\n\nAbout This Binding\n==================\n\nThe source code for this binding is available at [monodroid-samples on GitHub][1].\n\nJava packages are renamed in order them to conform to standard .NET naming conventions. For example, we rename \"com.actionbar.sherlock\" to \"Xamarin.ActionBarSherlockBinding\".\n\nFor a complete mapping see [Metadata.xml][5] in the source code.\n\n\nScreenshots\n===========\n\nNote that this component is primarily about action bars, navigation, so the additional content visible in the screenshots below was added solely for the purpose of demonstration.\n\nList navigation example:\n\n![List Navigation][3]\n\nFeature showcase (from \"FeatureToggles\" sample):\n\n![Feature showcase (from \"FeatureToggles\" sample)][4]\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/ActionBarSherlock\n[2]: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html\n[3]: https://components.xamarin.com/resources/icons/component-228/sshot_ListNavigation.png\n[4]: https://components.xamarin.com/resources/icons/component-228/sshot_FeatureToggles.png\n[5]: https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/blob/master/ActionBarSherlock/ActionBarSherlock/Transforms/Metadata.xml\n\n*Screenshots generated with [PlaceIt](http://placeit.breezi.com/).*","Version":"4.4.0","Summary":"Xamarin binding for ActionBarSherlock.","QuickStart":"ActionBarSherlock is a Java Android library that brings action bar feature,\nwhich became available in Android 4.0 API, to Android 2.x too.\n\nThis Java Android library is brought to Xamarin.Android by making use of\nJar Binding project. (In fact ActionBarSherlock is rather an \"Android library\"\nwhich requires some special care to deal with Android resources, but you\ndon\u0027t have to care about that unless you are making some changes in\nActionBarSherlock dll.)\n\nThe API is almost the same as the standard Android API (Android.App.ActionBar)\nin API Level 14 or later.\n\nBasic Project Setup\n===================\n\nActionBarSherlock binding is a simple single binding dll. It contains\nActionBarSherlock Java library and required resources internally, and\nXamarin.Android automagically includes them into your application apk.\n\nCreate a new Android Application project, and add a reference to\nActionBarSherlock.dll. With the component support in either of the IDEs\n(Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio), the dll is automatically added when\nyou add reference to the component.\n\nThe next step is mandatory: you have to set TargetFramework as Android 4.0\nor later: it is to resolve some Android resources which are available\nonly in that API Level.\n\n![Configure Target Framework][1]\n\nAlso it is important to set \"Minimum Android Version\" in the project\nproperty to lower API Level (ActionBarSherlock works on API Level 2.x).\nTo set this property, you need to create \"AndroidManifest.xml\". It can be\ncreated via the project options (\"Android Application\" tab).\n\n![Configure Android Application (AndroidManifest.xml)][2]\n\n(In theory you can skip this process, but that means your application won\u0027t\nrun on Android 2.x, which makes it pointless to use this library.)\n\nSimple ActionBar Example\n===================\n\nNow you are ready to write C# code.\n\nFirst, you might want to import these ActionBarSherlock\nnamespaces e.g.:\n\n    using Xamarin.ActionbarSherlockBinding.App;\n\nYou can use SherlockActivity as your activity:\n\n    public class FeatureToggles : SherlockActivity\n\nAnother important step is to apply Sherlock Theme. You would usually do it in\nSherlockActivity.OnCreate():\n\n    protected override void OnCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState)\n    {\n        SetTheme (Resource.Style.Theme_Sherlock);\n        base.OnCreate (savedInstanceState);\n    }\n\n![The Default App template with Sherlock theme applied][3]\n\nThis brings the basic ActionBar on top of the screen (Otherwise the button\nshowed up at the top of the screen). Now you can add various components\nof ActionBarSherlock onto this space.\n\n\nLearn by Features Showcase\n==========================\n\nActionBarSherlock provides many features and they are demonstrated in the\n(port of) demo sample appllication ([ActionBarSherlockTest in our github repo][4]).\n\nThe features include:\n\n- Options menu as List navigation. The menu items are shown on the action bar.\n  You override OnCreateOptionsMenu(IMenu menu) method and call menu.Add() to add items.\n\n![List navigation][5]\n\n- Tab navigation with optionally collapsible title bar.\n\n![Tab navigation][6]\n\n- Flexible actions. ShowAsAction could indicate e.g. 1) to show up only if\n  there is enough room, 2) to show collapsible action menu (when activated,\n  other menu items go away), 3) normal display etc.\n\n![Collapsible Action Items - default][7] ![Collapsible Action Items - collapsed search state][8]\n\n- Custom UI components on the action bar.\n- Progress controls (circle and line).\n\nSee the sample project sources to see how to write actual code.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/raw/master/ActionBarSherlock/components/sshot_TargetFramework.png\n[2]: https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/raw/master/ActionBarSherlock/components/sshot_AndroidManifest.png\n[3]: https://components.xamarin.com/resources/icons/component-228/sshot_SimpleTheme.png\n[4]: https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/ActionBarSherlock\n[5]: https://components.xamarin.com/resources/icons/component-228/sshot_ListNavigation.png\n[6]: https://components.xamarin.com/resources/icons/component-228/sshot_TabNavigation.png\n[7]: https://components.xamarin.com/resources/icons/component-228/sshot_CollapsibleActionItems1.png\n[8]: https://components.xamarin.com/resources/icons/component-228/sshot_CollapsibleActionItems2.png\n\n*Screenshots generated with [PlaceIt](http://placeit.breezi.com/).*","Hash":"67c76906801ef4c44b5c44e4ef57bc50","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
